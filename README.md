You can host your own server on replit, I have one setup on https://replit.com/@chatsociety but requests are rate limited.

You can connect to a custom server by specifying a url parameter such as `https://chatsociety.org/?https://myserver.com/server.php`

My main github is [github.com/mrbid](https://github.com/mrbid).

- Allow drawing on walls using GL_LINES arrays of points at equal distances from each other, one draw call for all player squiggles unless player can customize the `glLineWidth()` or color?<br>
- VOIP?

You can host your own server on replit, I have one setup on https://replit.com/@chatsociety but requests are rate limited.

Thoughts:
- Allow drawing on walls using GL_LINES arrays of points at equal distances from each other, one draw call for all player squiggles unless player can customize the `glLineWidth()` or color.
- VOIP?
